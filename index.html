                <p>My Love,</p>
                <p>Over the past six months, we've built something truly special together, brick by brick, just like our Lego vase. Each flower we add represents a lesson we've learned: understanding, compassion, tolerance, loving each other better, and taking care of each other more. As we pick up new Lego flowers today, let's celebrate these lessons and look forward to adding many more to our vase.</p>
                <p>With all my love,<br>Awan/Your PB</p>

                On this road, let's leave behind<br>
                Every memory, everything we found.<br>
                Nature, like love, needs no words,<br>
                Just our hearts to understand its calls.<br>
                Together we wander, together we stay,<br>
                As one with the earth, our love will never sway.</p>
